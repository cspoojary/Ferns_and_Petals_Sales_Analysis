# Ferns_and_Petals_Sales_Analysis
A comprehensive sales analysis dashboard built in Excel, designed to visualize and interpret customer ordering patterns, revenue trends, and product performance across different occasions and categories.

### Dataset used
I've been given a dataset from FNP (Ferns and Petals), a company that specializes in sending gifts for occasions like Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Holi, Valentine's Day, Birthdays, and Anniversaries. The dataset includes details about products, orders, customers, and relevant dates. My goal is to analyze this data to uncover key insights related to sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
